## Table of contents

## Overview

- Client: Altum Inc. (Startup)
- Aug. 2020 – Oct. 2020

### Summary

- Jenni’s inconsistent visual design necessitated a design system that unified visual elements and streamlined design work.

### Roles

- UX Designer, UI Designer

## Background

When I first joined Altum, I quickly learned that the “design system” was a bare bones color palette.

## Goals

I believed that starting a design system would result in faster launch time by way of less time spent designing while providing a more consistent visual branding across the experience/platform.

## Process

The steps of Altum's design process are:

- **Define.** Defining our users and the MVP design.
- **Ideate.** Ideating on design possibilities.
- **Test.** Testing pre-release ideations.
- **Observe.** Observing post-release outcomes.

## Define

I began by researching what exactly a design system is and the minimum I needed to make to get it going.

## Ideate

Before I left Altum, I finished three fundamental aspects.

## Test

Testing saw me incorporating the design system’s new additions into my workflow. I also self-gauged using my designer’s intuition to check the feel of using the design system.

## Observe

Overall the design system foundation I created for Jenni was a start in the right direction:

- Features were rolling out faster than those in previous sprints.
- Jenni had the beginnings of a much-needed unified visual experience.

## Reflection

Learning to create a design system was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor that showed me how difficult it can be to create a set of standards for a product’s visual design.

## Next steps

My next move with growing the design system would have been to:

- Recreate our most used design components.
- Create a collective sheet for ease of use.
