## Table of contents

## Overview

- Client: Altum Inc. (Startup)
- Duration: Nov. 2019 – Oct. 2020

### Summary

- Collaboratively created 6 crucial features to assist with faster article delivery.

### Roles

- UX Designer, UI Designer, User Researcher

## Background

With complaints about our articles’ quality and delivery time, Altum looked to research, design, and test AI tools for its content writing service, Jenni AI, that would help improve Jenni’s word processor.

## Goals

We hypothesized that proper AI features would help content writers deliver high quality articles faster and decrease the number of client complaints about late articles.

## Process

The steps of Altum's design process are:

- **Define.** Defining our users and the MVP design.
- **Ideate.** Ideating on design possibilities.
- **Test.** Testing pre-release ideations.
- **Observe.** Observing post-release outcomes.

## Define

Our first move was to interview content writers who noted issues such as:

- Difficulties in adapting references into articles.
- Lowering the plagiarism score.

## Ideate

I shared low and high-fidelity wireframes for feedback on each AI tool.

The AI tools addressed the various problems writers faced and addressed business needs as well.

<p class="post-image">The Simplifier also expedited lowering plagiarism scores by rewording input text to simplify it.</p>

<p class="post-image">The Express modal, while not an AI tool, organized the AI tools in a more intuitive way.</p>

## Test

We optimized for the most results with the least investment by conducting budget usability tests.

## Observe

We tracked:

- The number of late articles to measure writing time.
- The number of client complaints.

Subsequently our results showed that:

- Overall writing time didn’t go down.
- The number of client complaints didn’t go down.

## Reflection

The AI-Powered Word Processor didn’t meet its success metrics because the field of designing for AI usability is still new and the technology itself has a ways to go.

## Next steps

My next steps would’ve been to continue researching into improving the usability of our AI tools.
