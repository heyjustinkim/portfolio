## Goals

By addressing core pain points for users (or showing promise for doing so), we believed that prospective customers would sign up for Jenni.

## Process

The steps of Altum's design process are:

- **Define.** Defining our users and the MVP design.
- **Ideate.** Ideating on design possibilities.
- **Test.** Testing pre-release ideations.
- **Observe.** Observing post-release outcomes.

## Define

Our users, SEO marketers and content writers, shared similar issues:

- Long editing times to properly reword text for the target audience’s reading level.
- Difficulty lowering an article’s plagiarism score.

## Ideate

EasyRead consists of 2 main tools, the reading level analysis tool and the simplifying tool.

## Test

To deliver quick results and recommended changes to development on EasyRead’s design we scheduled 3 quick usability testing sessions.

Once development was finished we soft-launched EasyRead on a popular SEO Facebook group, SEO Signals Lab, to drum up interest and convert hot leads.

## Reflection

For a small startup, even one customer is the difference between life and death, so we were happy to see all this interest in our product.
