_You've done it. Despite stressing out over everything else in life, your garden is complete. It took a lot of time, energy, and resources, but it's done._

_At least, until you spotted the weed in the middle of it._

_[AÂ Weed in the Garden](https://bruhstin.itch.io/weed-in-garden)_ is a clickable text adventure made with [Gruescript](https://versificator.itch.io/gruescript) by Robin Johnson for the [DIA Game Jam](https://www.diadesign.io/what-is-the-dia-game-jam/). The theme was "stress".
