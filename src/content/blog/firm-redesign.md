## Background

Brinkerhoff Evaluation Institute (BEI) sought a redesigned web presence that centered around its Success Case Method (SCM) and the legacy of its founder’s, Robert Brinkerhoff’s, approach to evaluation work.

The original website design was outdated and lacked responsiveness for multiple device widths. Also its customer conversion pipeline consisted solely of users navigating to the contact page.

## Goal

Based on our initial calls BEI needed a modern, usable website that persuaded potential clients to sign up for the Institute’s SCM training course.

## Methods

I worked alongside a team of 4 which included a Project Manager, a Team Lead, and a UX Researcher. As the team’s UX Generalist, I worked on:

- Interviewing stakeholders.
- Analyzing competitor services.
- Redesigning the Institute’s branding and creating wireframes using Figma, a design tool.
- Implementing wireframes in Webflow, a low-code development platform.

## Results

The deliverables for the client included:

- Interview findings.
- A competitive analysis with insights.
- A brand kit.
- Mockups showing the website’s design.
- A website made in and hosted on Webflow.

The new website we made for BEI resulted in a cleaner visual appearance with intentional call-to-action placements to encourage users to sign up for the SCM course.
