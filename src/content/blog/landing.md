## Table of contents

## Overview

- Client: Altum Inc. (Startup)
- Duration: Nov. 2019 – Oct. 2020

### Summary

- Jenni, Altum’s content writing service, needed a new landing page that reflected Altum’s changing business models and focuses.

### Roles

- UX Designer, UI Designer, User Researcher

## Background

Altum saw the need to add and alter content on the landing site to better reflect the Jenni writing service.

## Goals

We hypothesized that making both simple iterative changes and major visual overhauls would result in an increase in conversions (# of accounts) and signups (# of payment info submissions).

## Process

The steps of Altum's design process are:

- **Define.** Defining our users and the MVP design.
- **Ideate.** Ideating on design possibilities.
- **Test.** Testing pre-release ideations.
- **Observe.** Observing post-release outcomes.

## Define

Our primary target users were SEO marketers and marketing agencies.

## Test

Our main testing methods included:

- User testing to gain a qualitative perspective on the effectiveness of intended landing site design changes.
- A/B testing using Crazy Egg, a service that records and highlights user interactions.

<p class="post-image">Part of an audit report where I used CrazyEgg’s heatmap and confetti features to highlight areas with frequent user activity. I believed these areas took priority in the next redesign.</p>

## Observe

Based on our success metrics of an increase in conversions and an increase in signups, we found that altering the landing site resulted in more conversions and signups for certain changes.

## Reflection

I learned that by making simple changes and keeping a good record of wireframes, UI elements, etc. one could provide meaningful impact for the business.
