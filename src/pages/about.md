## Interests

In my spare time I:

- Make games. Currently focusing on [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).
- Play games (of course). My favorite genres include Tactical RPG's, Side-scrolling Platformers, and Interactive Fiction.
- Organize for San Gabriel Valley UX. Come [hang out](https://sgvux.design/) with us!
- Read detective fiction. Some of my favorite novels are from the [Honkaku/Shin Honkaku schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_detective_fiction)!
- Collect music! I love supporting indie artists on Bandcamp.
