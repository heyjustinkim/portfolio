## Interests

In my spare time I:

- Make [games](https://bruhstin.itch.io/). Currently focusing on [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).
- Play games (of course). My favorite games have labels such as Text Adventures, Point-and-Click Adventures, Tactical RPG's, Platformers, and Metroidvanias.
- Practice Buddhism. I decided to follow the Buddha's teachings in early 2024.
- Read books. Some of my favorite genres include detective fiction, religion, and horror.
- Collect music! I love supporting indie artists on Bandcamp.
- Practice divination. I'm an avid Tarot reader and enjoy learning other systems such as Lenormand, I-Ching, and dice divination. Disclaimer: As a Buddhist, I personally don't read fortunes.
- Organize for San Gabriel Valley UX. Come [hang out](https://sgvux.design/) with us!
