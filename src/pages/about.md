Justin is a Paralegal Student currently attending Mt. San Antonio College's Paralegal/Legal Assistant program. He anticipates graduating with an Associate Degree in June 2026.

He attended the University of California San Diego (UCSD) for a Bachelor of Science degree in Cognitive Science: Human-Computer Interaction. After graduating from UCSD in 2019, he began a career as a User Experience (UX) Generalist and consulted on UX matters for startups. Justin has worked on a variety of projects ranging from Artificial Intelligence to Online Publications. Along the way he honed his skills in UX Design, User Research, Web Development, and Content Writing.

After 5 years he decided to harness his love of writing and pivot into a career as a Paralegal. With his technology background and current education track, he hopes to leverage his skillset in Intellectual Property law as well as legal technology.

Outside of work and classes, Justin enjoys playing games and reading. He is also learning how to make games again by learning the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).

<!-- I'm a designer in LA who also enjoys coding, writing, strategizing, and more.

<!-- ## Interests

In my spare time I:

- Make [games](https://bruhstin.itch.io/). Currently focusing on [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).
- Play games (of course). My favorite games have labels such as Text Adventures, Point-and-Click Adventures, Tactical RPG's, Platformers, and Metroidvanias.
- Practice Buddhism. I decided to follow the Buddha's teachings in early 2024.
- Read books. Some of my favorite genres include detective fiction, religion, and horror.
- Collect music! I love supporting indie artists on Bandcamp.
- Practice divination. I'm an avid Tarot reader and enjoy learning other systems such as Lenormand, I-Ching, and dice divination. Disclaimer: As a Buddhist, I personally don't read fortunes.
- Help apprentices as a [DIA Mentor](https://www.diadesign.io/2022-new-year-new-mentors/). We're always looking for more mentors to help us out!
- Organize for San Gabriel Valley UX. Come [hang out](https://sgvux.design/) with us! -->
